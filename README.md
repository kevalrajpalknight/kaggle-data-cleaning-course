Kaggle - Data Cleaning Fundamental Course Material
I've successfully completed Kaggle - Data Cleaning Course. It was so interesting, way the course was designed and helpful optional references for more understanding of topics.
It cover most of fundamentals of Data Cleaning i.e. Dealing with Missing Values, Scaling and Normalization, DateTime Parsing, File Encoding and Inconsistent Data Entry values (Typos).
